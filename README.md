### Overview

#### Setup

- Checkout this repo.
- Install [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/).
- In a terminal, from the `code/` directory, run `npm install`.

#### Usage

From the `code/` directory, run `npm run dev`.

This will start a [`live-server`](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) instance that hosts this folder. It will also start a browser tab pointed at `http://localhost:8080`. The `live-server` will tell the webpage to reload automatically on any change to any file in this folder. This allows for quick iteration.

Edit the file `code/src/solution.js` and commit!
